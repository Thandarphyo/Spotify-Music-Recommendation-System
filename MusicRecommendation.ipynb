Personalized music recommendations have become an essential tool in the digital music landscape, enabling music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to offer personalized and engaging experiences to their users.

These data points are instrumental in constructing comprehensive user profiles, delineating individual tastes and preferences.\n",

Subsequently, the system uses recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to generate music recommendations.\n",
